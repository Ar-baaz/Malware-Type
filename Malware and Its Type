Malware stands for “Malicious Software” and it is designed to gain access or installed into the computer without the consent of the user. They perform unwanted tasks in the host computer for the benefit of a third party. There is a full range of malwares which can seriously degrade the performance of the host machine. There is a full range of malwares which are simply written to distract/annoy the user, to the complex ones which captures the sensitive data from the host machine and send it to remote servers. There are various types of malwares present in the Internet. Some of the popular ones are:


•	Adware
It is a special type of malware which is used for forced advertising. They either redirect the page to some advertising page or pop-up an additional page which promotes some product or event. This adware is financially supported by the organizations whose products are advertised.


•	Spyware
It is a special type of which is installed in the target computer with or without the user permission and is designed to steal sensitive information from the target machine. Mostly it gathers the browsing habits of the user and the send it to the remote server without the knowledge of the owner of the computer. Most of the time they are downloaded in to the host computer while downloading freeware i.e. free application programs from the internet. Spywares may be of various types; It can keeps track of the cookies of the host computer, it can act as a keyloggers to sniff the banking passwords and sensitive information, etc.


•	Browser hijacking software
There is some malicious software which are downloaded along with the free software offered over the internet and installed in the host computer without the knowledge of the user. This software modifies the browsers setting and redirect links to other unintentional sites.


•	Virus
A virus is a malicious code written to damage/harm the host computer by deleting or appending a file, occupy memory space of the computer by replicating the copy of the code, slow down the performance of the computer, format the host machine, etc. It can be spread via email attachment, pen drives, digital images, e-greeting, audio or video clips, etc. A virus may be present in a computer but it cannot activate itself without the human intervention. Until and unless the executable file(.exe) is execute, a virus cannot be activated in the host machine.


•	Worms
They are a class of virus which can replicate themselves. They are different from the virus by the fact that they do not require human intervention to travel over the network and spread from the infected machine to the whole network. Worms can spread either through network, using the loopholes of the Operating System or via email. The replication and spreading of the worm over the network consume the network resources like space and bandwidth and force the network to choke.


•	Trojan Horse
Trojan horse is a malicious code that is installed in the host machine by pretending to be useful software. The user clicks on the link or download the file which pretends to be a useful file or software from legitimate source. It not only damages the host computer by manipulating the data but also it creates a backdoor in the host computer so that it could be controlled by a remote computer. It can become a part of botnet(robot-network), a network of computers which are infected by malicious code and controlled by central controller. The computers of this network which are infected by malicious code are known as zombies. Trojans neither infect the other computers in the network nor do they replicate.
